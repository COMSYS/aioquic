Content of this forked repository
--------------------

This is a modified variant of ``aioquic`` with the intention of studying the performance of different `EFM algorithms <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mdt-ippm-explicit-flow-measurements/>`_ algorithms.

Modifications of this variant
....
- There is an additional byte after the `Spin Bit` (measurement header)
    - It is enabled by default
    - To disable the measurement header:
        1. Set the `Active` attribute of the `Measurement_Headers` class in `src/aioquic/quic/__init__.py` to False
        2. Set the `MeasurementHeaders` variable in `src/aioquic/_crypto.c` to something other than 1
- The header protection has been removed from the two reserved bits in the short header as well as the measurement header (if it is enabled)
- Datagram packets no longer count towards the `in flight` counting, i.e., congestion-control is effectively disabled (`src/aioquic/quic/packet.py`)
- `src/aioquic/quic/packet_builder.py` contains **tested** end-host logic for the EFM variants focussing on loss (L|Q|R|T)
    - There are also implementations for EFM variants focussing on delay (two variants of the delay bit, one variant for the VEC). These are **not tested** yet. Please use with caution.
- By default, if the measurement header is active, **all** implemented EFM variants are active and are added to each outgoing packet (see `src/aioquic/quic/packet_builder.py` : `_end_packet`)
    - If the measurement header is disabled, it is possible to precisely define which EFM variants should be mapped onto the two reserved bits of the real QUIC short header (see `src/aioquic/quic/configuration.py`)

- Hooks for the EFM variants
    - All EFM variants are hooked at the datagram reception in `src/aioquic/quic/connection.py` 
    - The LBit implementation is further embedded in the loss detection in `src/aioquic/quic/recovery.py`

What is ``aioquic``?
--------------------

``aioquic`` is a library for the QUIC network protocol in Python. It features
a minimal TLS 1.3 implementation, a QUIC stack and an HTTP/3 stack.

QUIC standardisation is not finalised yet, but ``aioquic`` closely tracks the
specification drafts and is regularly tested for interoperability against other
`QUIC implementations`_.

To learn more about ``aioquic`` please `read the documentation`_.

Why should I use ``aioquic``?
-----------------------------

``aioquic`` has been designed to be embedded into Python client and server
libraries wishing to support QUIC and / or HTTP/3. The goal is to provide a
common codebase for Python libraries in the hope of avoiding duplicated effort.

Both the QUIC and the HTTP/3 APIs follow the "bring your own I/O" pattern,
leaving actual I/O operations to the API user. This approach has a number of
advantages including making the code testable and allowing integration with
different concurrency models.

Features
--------

- QUIC stack conforming with draft-28
- HTTP/3 stack conforming with draft-28
- minimal TLS 1.3 implementation
- IPv4 and IPv6 support
- connection migration and NAT rebinding
- logging TLS traffic secrets
- logging QUIC events in QLOG format
- HTTP/3 server push support

Requirements
------------

``aioquic`` requires Python 3.6 or better, and the OpenSSL development headers.

Linux
.....

On Debian/Ubuntu run:

.. code-block:: console

   $ sudo apt install libssl-dev python3-dev

On Alpine Linux you will also need the following:

.. code-block:: console

   $ sudo apt install bsd-compat-headers libffi-dev

OS X
....

On OS X run:

.. code-block:: console

   $ brew install openssl

You will need to set some environment variables to link against OpenSSL:

.. code-block:: console

   $ export CFLAGS=-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include
   $ export LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib

Windows
.......

On Windows the easiest way to install OpenSSL is to use `Chocolatey`_.

.. code-block:: console

   > choco install openssl

You will need to set some environment variables to link against OpenSSL:

.. code-block:: console

  > $Env:INCLUDE = "C:\Progra~1\OpenSSL-Win64\include"
  > $Env:LIB = "C:\Progra~1\OpenSSL-Win64\lib"

Running the examples
--------------------

`aioquic` comes with a number of examples illustrating various QUIC usecases.
